"NBgpPaz5vYhkr6GEc","debate-ai-safety-or-ai-control","Debate: AI safety or AI control?","This post presents a debate between focusing on AI safety (ensuring AI systems are fundamentally safe and aligned) versus AI control (developing methods to monitor and constrain AI systems). The debate explores different threat models, timelines, and strategic considerations for reducing AI existential risk.","https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NBgpPaz5vYhkr6GEc/debate-ai-safety-or-ai-control","Paul Christiano","paul-christiano","127","48","23","2024-11-20T10:30:00.000Z","4200"
"h9KPXqwKnJ7dMxZ3r","risks-from-learned-optimization","Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems","This post analyzes the risks that emerge when machine learning systems develop mesa-optimizers—learned algorithms that perform optimization internally. We examine how base optimizers training learned optimizers can lead to misalignment between the mesa-objective and the base objective, creating potential safety hazards.","https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/h9KPXqwKnJ7dMxZ3r/risks-from-learned-optimization","Evan Hubinger","evan-hubinger","203","87","45","2024-10-15T14:22:00.000Z","8900"
